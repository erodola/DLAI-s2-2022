### Pre-requisites

Programming fundamentals in **Python**; calculus; linear algebra.

### Textbook and reading material

Due to the continuously evolving nature of the topic, there is no fixed textbook as a reference. Specific material in the form of scientific articles and book chapters will be given throughout the lectures.

### Grading

Evaluation proceeds according to the following steps:

- A midterm self-evaluation test (optional, does not concur to the final grade)
- A final written exam (**mandatory**, accounts for 60% of the final grade)
- A project (**mandatory**, accounts for 40% of the final grade)
- An oral exam (optional, attributes at most 3 points, added to or subtracted from the final grade)

The _cum laude_ can be obtained only by taking the oral exam. For students who already have a very high score with written exam + project, the oral exam is meant to confirm the high score.

The list of projects will be published at a later time.

Here you can find some example sheets of past written exams:
